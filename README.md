# dotfiles

My dotfiles.

`etc` folder should be copied to `/`. All other directories and files (except README.md and LICENSE) should be copied to home folder.

Maybe I add installation shell script in future.

## Notes

* .vimrc depends on [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). Install it, then open Vim and run `:PluginInstall`.
* If you wish to keep YouCompleteMe plugin please [follow installation guide](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe).
